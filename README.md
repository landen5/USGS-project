### Abstract
Our primary question is: how do wildfires affect shoreline position? We seek to answer this question through understanding, visualizing, and utilizing Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to evaluate the relationship between wildfires and shoreline change. Climate change leads to increased frequency and severity of wildfires and precipitation which increases fluvial sediment discharge and therefore increases sediment inputs in littoral cells, causing beach expansion.  Our approach includes building a model using MLR which not only factors in wildfires but also includes other factors such as wave direction, wave power, among others to gain a broader understanding of shoreline change. Through our paper, it is our hope that we can leverage the existing tools and data to both reinforce existing understandings of how climate change is affecting California's coastal regions, as well as develop a more robust and intuitive interpretation of coastal developments. 

### Background
At all times the coastlines around the globe are impacted by innumerable environmental factors like seasonal currents, sediment discharge, and biological cycles. These influences place our coastlines in a perpetual and often periodic tug of war for ground against the elements. A developed understanding of these coastal behaviors allows for regions to better predict and address environmental threats to infrastructure, coastal communities, and ecosystems. And it has historically been the role of national agencies like the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to track the seasonal cycles of Coastline expansion and contractions via ground-based observations; often imploring the use of technology like GPS and LIDAR to meticulously track coastline positions throughout the year. With the development of satellite imaging technology and a general abundance of coastline imaging data, satellites have allowed the USGS and similar agencies to create shoreline modeling tools like the Coastal Storm Modelling System(CoSMoS). Patrick Barnard, a USGS research geologist, says, "Satellite data provides the opportunity to build a consistent approach that's robust and data tested, with hundreds to thousands of data points in every location, all without having to spend the time and money to travel and work on site". The vast amounts of data accumulated under the Landsat Program, a joint NASA & USGS Earth observing satellite campaign, has provided the means for developing new climate change prediction models such as CoSMoS and CoastSat. In recent years, California has seen an increase in the frequency and severity of climate events such as wildfires, downpours, and subsequent flooding. These coast and climate observation tools have proven paramount to understanding the ways in which recent climate trends have come to impact coastal ecosystems and communities. In order to do so, we began looking at several coastal sites up and down California's coast and eventually settled on a beach in Big Sur(Andrew Molera Beach) with close proximity to a river mouth. This site in recent years has experienced increased fluvial sediment discharge, a development closely correlated with joint rain and wildfire-based erosion. These climate-based coastal contractions and expansions at this particular site have designated this beach as our choice candidate to develop our understanding of climate-induced coastal change.
